    "This one is a little more complicated since information from the songs table, artists table, and original log file are all needed for the `songplays` table. Since the log file does not specify an ID for either the song or the artist, you'll need to get the song ID and artist ID by querying the songs and artists tables to find matches based on song title, artist name, and song duration time.\n",
    "- Implement the `song_select` query in `sql_queries.py` to find the song ID and artist ID based on the title, artist name, and duration of a song.\n",
    "- Select the timestamp, user ID, level, song ID, artist ID, session ID, location, and user agent and set to `songplay_data`\n",

    "#### Insert Records into Songplays Table\n",
    "- Implement the `songplay_table_insert` query and run the cell below to insert records for the songplay actions in this log file into the `songplays` table. Remember to run `create_tables.py` before running the cell below to ensure you've created/resetted the `songplays` table in the sparkify database."
